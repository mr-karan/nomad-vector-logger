# nomad-vector-logger

A daemon which continuously watches for deployments in a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster and generates a [Vector](https://vector.dev/) configuration file which can be used to collect logs enriched with Nomad **metadata**.

Each log event is annotated with the following metadata:

- Namesapce of the application
- Node where the deployment is running
- Job name
- Group name
- Task name
- Allocation ID

## Why

### Problem

Currently, Nomad stores all application logs inside `$NOMAD_DATA_DIR/$NOMAD_ALLOC_DIR/logs/` directory. The limitation is that these logs don't have any information about the task/job/allocation etc. If there are multiple deployments on the same host, it's impossible for any central log collecting agent to distinguish and process these logs uniquely.

For `docker` driver, this is a non-issue since logging of tasks with docker driver is configured with [`logging`](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker#config-1) stanza.

Users running deployments with `raw_exec` and `exec` as the task driver will find that no such configuration exists as mentioned in this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/10219).

### Solution

- `nomad-vector-logger` is a daemon which runs in the background, periodically polling for running `Allocations` on the node.
- It then generates a `vector` configuration to collect logs from the allocation's log directory and enriches the log event with relevant metadata.
- `vector` is started with a [`--watch-config`](https://vector.dev/docs/administration/management/#reloading) flag which automatically live-reloads `vector` whenever config changes. A config change can happen whenever an allocation is _created/stopped/restarted_.

You can see a sample [config file](./sample/nomad.toml) that is generated by this daemon. This config file can be used in addition with other `vector` config files to provide the config for rest of pipeline (additional transformations, sinks etc).

#### Before

Logs without any metdata on `/opt/nomad/data/alloc/$ALLOC_ID/alloc/logs`:

```
==> proxy.stdout.0 <==
192.168.29.76 - - [03/Sep/2022:17:30:36 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 27 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0" "-"
```

#### After

This is an example JSON log collected from `nginx` task running with `raw_exec` task driver on Nomad, collected using `vector`:

```json
{
    "file": "/opt/nomad/data/alloc/64a2f9fd-e003-0bb3-b5cd-838125283a06/alloc/logs/proxy.stdout.0",
    "host": "pop-os",
    "message": "192.168.29.76 - - [03/Sep/2022:17:30:36 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 27 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0\" \"-\"",
    "nomad": {
        "alloc_id": "64a2f9fd-e003-0bb3-b5cd-838125283a06",
        "group_name": "nginx",
        "job_name": "nginx",
        "namespace": "default",
        "node_name": "pop-os",
        "task_name": "proxy"
    },
    "source_type": "file",
    "timestamp": "2022-09-03T17:30:42.569487273Z"
}
```

## Dev Setup

```
make dev
```

You can refer to a local dev suite which runs this program in a Nomad cluster. The [jobspec](./dev/deployment.nomad) can also be used as a reference for production deployment.

## Deployment Notes

- This program is meant to be run inside a Nomad cluster and should have proper ACL to fetch `Allocation:*` events. You can use this ACL policy to generate a token:

```hcl
namespace "*" {
  policy = "read"
}

node {
  policy = "read"
}

agent {
  policy = "read"
}
```

- It's preferable to run it as `system` job. Each allocation of this program will be responsible to configure `vector` to collect logs from that particular log directory on the host.

You can choose one of the various deployment options:

### Binary

Grab the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/mr-karan/nomad-vector-logger/releases).

To run:

```
$ ./nomad-vector-logger.bin --config config.toml
```

### Nomad

View a sample deployment file at [examples/deployment.nomad](./examples/deployment.nomad).

### Docker 

Docker images are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mr-karan/nomad-vector-logger/pkgs/container/nomad-vector-logger).

## Configuration

Refer to [config.sample.toml](./config.sample.toml) for a list of configurable values.

### Environment Variables

All config variables can also be populated as env vairables by prefixing `NOMAD_VECTOR_LOGGER_` and replacing `.` with `__`.

For eg: `app.data_dir` becomes `NOMAD_VECTOR_LOGGER_app__data_dir`.
